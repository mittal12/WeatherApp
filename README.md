# WeatherApp
This weather app is built with the DarkSky API. It has three view controllers.  A welcome view controller that displays a list of the cities that were selected, with an option to search for and add another city with the search view controller. The saved cities can also be deleted.  The cities are saved with core data/persistence container. The main view controller is the weather details view controller.  The weather details view controller displays current conditions for the selected city including the temperature, weather summary, appropriate weather icon, along with wind speed, humidity and barometric pressure.  There is also a scrollable table view controller below the current weathter conditions that displays the forecast for the coming days.
